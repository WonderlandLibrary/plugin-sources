/**
 * The hit detection in Minecraft is mostly determined by the client,
 * thus servers are left to trust the client. (There are a few exceptions
 * for the unmodified Notchian server such as preventing hits exceeding 6
 * blocks from the target entity). This poses a problem for players and
 * server owners since players can modify the client to manipulate hit
 * detection and allow for cheating when in combat with other players.
 *
 * Hawk’s hitbox checking aims to detect cheating during player vs.
 * player combat by validating hits on the server. When the server
 * receives an interaction packet from the client, Hawk gets the client’s
 * last known position and next direction, and uses it to perform a ray
 * trace test on the victim’s hitbox. Before the ray-trace test begins,
 * though, Hawk must factor in latency by rewinding the victim’s hitbox
 * to an appropriate time based on the client’s ping latency. To
 * accomplish this, Hawk keeps a history of players’ positions and
 * timestamps in a table and it retrieves a position that best
 * approximates where it appeared to the client when the client attacked
 * it. Hawk then performs the ray-trace test to determine whether the
 * client landed the hit or not. Although the system may produce false
 * positives with clients on unstable connections, it is a fair tradeoff
 * between user experience and cheat prevention.
 *
 * There are other sources of error which will probably not be accounted
 * for in Hawk anytime soon. Other sources of error include:
 *   - The client receives entity relative moves in 1/32 block precision.
 *   - The client holds off one tick to smoothly animate other players
 *     on the screen in the case of slight network jitter. It will
 *     linearly interpolate from the last position to the latest
 *     position up to 3 ticks if it doesn't receive a relative move
 *     packet to update the player's position.
 *   - The client will predict the motion of some entities, such as
 *     arrows. If there is latency and something unexpected happens
 *     to the entity, the client may desynchronize from the server.
 *
 * In most cases, the client uses the current frame's yaw and pitch to
 * compute the direction vector for the attack hit-scan. Fortunately,
 * ticking and rendering is done in the same thread. Unfortunately, in
 * the tick stack, attacking is done before sending yaw/pitch updates
 * to the server, which means that we must wait until the next flying
 * packet to get the direction of the hit-scan.
 *
 * For realtime protection, it's best to use the EntityInteractDirection
 * check. It actively enforces directions, but it extrapolates the
 * yaw/pitch because of how the client hit-scanning works.
